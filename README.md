# Field-Oriented-Control-of-Permanent-Magnet-Synchronous-Motor
#Overview
## Overview

This repository contains the source code, simulations, and documentation related to my thesis on the implementation of Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM). The work is aimed at enhancing the performance and efficiency of PMSMs, which are widely used in various industrial applications due to their high power density and efficiency.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this thesis are:

- To design and implement a Field-Oriented Control strategy for PMSM.
- To develop a mathematical model of PMSM.
- To simulate the PMSM and FOC using MATLAB/Simulink.
- To validate the performance of the control strategy through simulations and experimental setups.
- To discuss various modulation techniques.
- To discuss difference tuning techniques.
